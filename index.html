                time. Overall, great app!"</p>

            <p>I love to use Expat Journal. The best social application I've experienced. By following the pages it
                gives all the recent posts. I reconneced with my childhool friends from this application. Good app to
                share lifes moments. Also, I can share my ideas here.
